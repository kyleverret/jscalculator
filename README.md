JavaScript Calculator

I am teaching myself JavaScript. This calculator is my second JavaScript project.
 
Debug: 
* limit the size of the number string so that it does not exceed the size of the result screen box.

Improve:(CSS is not really my thing - I skipped over CSS to get to work on learning JavaScript)
* style.
* correct problem where resizing of the screen distorts the calculator.
